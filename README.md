# Pentesting-Course-Notes

This repository contains my personal notes from my pentesting course. It serves as a reference for concepts and techniques that were new to me or that I found important to retain.

## Level 1: Reconnaissance on the Customer's External Infrastructure

Passive methods for searching domain names and subdomains:
- dnsdumpster.com
- shodan.io
- censys.io
- crt.sh
- pentest-tools.com

Active subdomain enumeration using amass:
```
amass enum -v -src -ip -d <site.com>
```

Data to gather during reconnaissance:

- Domain names
- "Live" IP addresses
- Open ports
- Operating system versions
- Services running on ports
- Web technologies in use

Useful tools for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):

- osintframework.com
- awesome-osint repository

For fast network scanning, consider using masscan.

## Level 2: Initial Access Attacks

Initial Access Attacks involve unauthorized attempts to gain access to systems, networks, or applications with the aim of acquiring the initial level of access and infiltrating them.

ffuf is a useful utility for scanning website directories:
```
ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -fc 403
```

Key terms:

- DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): A network segment located between the external and internal networks.
- DC (Domain Controller): A server that performs account management functions.
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Used to detect attacks.
- IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Used to detect and prevent attacks.
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): A vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests from the server to other resources.
